# Recent Podio items and apps in Google Chrome
This is a Google Chrome extension that keeps track of which items and apps you visit on [Podio](http://podio.com/). Clicking the extension's icon will give you a list of the last 10 items and last 10 apps. When you click the pushpin next to one of them it becomes 'sticky' and will always stay at the top.

Think of this extension as an automated Podio bookmarking. You could for example use it for keeping links to items you are currently working on easily available.
